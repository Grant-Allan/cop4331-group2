Populate each section with information as it applies to your project. If a section does not apply, explain why. Include diagrams (or links to diagrams) in each section, as appropriate. For example, sketches of the user interfaces along with an explanation of how the interface components will work; ERD diagrams of the database; rough class diagrams; context diagrams showing the system boundary; etc.

# Data Design

We are not using databases for this project. All data will be stored in data structures of various types.

# Business Rules

You should list the assumptions, rules, and guidelines from external sources that are impacting your program design. 

# User Interface Design

* [UI and User Stories Table](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_HayEiugMIzurYnrgulZgZl15rbOsW379TlGrbu7EnQ)

You should have one or more user interface screens in this section. Each screen should be accompanied by an explaination of the screens purpose and how the user will interact with it. You should relate each screen to one another as the user transitions through the states of your application. You should also have a table that relates each window or component to the support using stories.
