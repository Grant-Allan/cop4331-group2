1. For the ages of preteens to young adults
2. Who are looking for a simple, yet satisfying form of entertainment
3. The product is a game
4. That leads to fun without a huge time commitment or high skill
5. Unlike most other PC games on the market
6. Our product offers simplicity and replay value through randomization
